# Webmaps-in-Python-and-Folium
This is a personal project in learning on how to make a webmap in python using folium and pandas as well as some volcanoes as examples.
world is a json file which it is part of one the layers in the webmap in which countries are color coded based on population.
usa_volcano and japanese_volcano are txt files that contain some of their own volcanoes that are used in both python files.

What this accomplishes, was learning how to use folium as well as pandas and some of their methods in making a webmap.
map1.py is my first attempt of using some of the volcanoes in the U.S. in order to practice in making webmaps.

map2.py is my second attempt of using some of the volcanoes in Japan, as well as also inserting a link in the popup will lead to a webpage containing more info on the volcano.

The final output for both python files is an html file that has markers of the volcanoes as one layer, while also having the world coded population as another layer

# Webmaps-in-Python-and-Folium
This is a personal project in learning on how to make a webmap in python using some volcanoes as examples.

What this accomplishes, was learning how to use folium as well as pandas and some of their methods in making a webmap.
map1.py is my first attempt of using some of the volcanoes in the U.S. in order to practice in making webmaps.

map2.py is my second attempt of using some of the volcanoes in Japan, and also inserting a link in the popup that may lead to a google search of the volcano.
